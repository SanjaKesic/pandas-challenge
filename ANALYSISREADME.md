### ANALYSIS
We are analyzing the factors that could influence overall grades and passing rates of math and/or reading.

•	In regards to the overall % passing rate per school, district schools significantly underperformed charter schools. The gap is especially pronounced in the category of the percentage of students passing math. 
•	Overall passing rate does not seem to be dependent on per-student budget or total school budget. Schools which fared the worse in this category had higher budgets than schools that performed well in overall percentage passing rate. In fact, schools in the highest per-student budget category ($645-$680) had the lowest overall passing rates (around 53%)
•	It also seems that school size could be a factor in overall percentage passing rate category, although more research would be needed. I would also add more bins (in 500 count increments) in order to establish whether this is a trend. It seems that the schools with the total of students higher than 2700  underperformed small and medium size schools (<2700 students per school).  
•	Student grade does not seem to be a factor at all in overall success in math or reading.
